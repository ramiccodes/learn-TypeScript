// Object Types
// The types we looked so far are number, string, and boolean
// The fourth one is the object type
// An example would be {age:30}
// It is any JavaScript object, more specific types (type of object) are possible
var person = {
    name: 'Max',
    age: 30
};
console.log(person.nickname);
